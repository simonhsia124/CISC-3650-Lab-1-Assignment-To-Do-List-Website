      <h2>How to use this to do list</h2>
      <ul>  
        In order to add a task: 
        <li>Write the task in the textbox and then click the green button that saids "Click here to add the task!"</li> 
        <li>Made a mistake and need to delete one task or all tasks?</li>  
        <li>1. Click the yellow button that saids "Click here to delete a task!" to delete a single task</li>
        <li>2. Click the red button that saids "Click here to delete all tasks!" to delete all tasks</li>
        <li> Reminder: The Yellow Button only deletes the most recent task you made and the Red button deletes all the tasks
          you have made</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>

        Once a task has been made:
        <li>You have three things to do once a task is made:</li>
        <li>        1. There is a checkbox next to the task you have created and you can only click that checkbox to
          indicate whether you have completed your task or not</li>
        <li>2. There is a way for you to set a due date of your task </li>
        <li>3. You can set the importance level of your tasks with 3 colors</li>
        <li>        
          (Red = Very Important Task) 
          (Yellow = Moderately important) 
          (Green = Not very important but should still be considered)</li>
        

        

      </ul>
